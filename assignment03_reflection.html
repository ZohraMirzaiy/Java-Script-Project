    Assignment03-Reflection
</h2>

<p>
    Assignment03 among all the assignments that I have done in this semester was one of the most challenging one. From the beginning of Java-script lessons it was very difficult for me to understand all the lessons
    but this assignment was very helpful and allowed me to exercise the lessons by myself. While doing the assignment I encounter several challenges and problems where my codes showed error and so many times I asked my classmates and others for helps.
    This assignment took me around 4 days to complete and submit it but I have learned several new things from it which I am sure will help me in my future assignments.
    I watched the previous recordings so many times in order to find out where was my problem that my codes did not work well. This assignment with all its challenges was one the best project I have ever had and work on it. Doing this assignment made me realize that nothing is easy but after trying so hard you will see that it was you who did it and the way that you thought about it now everything is all set up. After doing the HTML and CSS projects which were much difficult than this, this assignment was challenging not only in coding but also to debag it and find where was the problem. I have learned so many new concepts after finishing this assignment that hopefully will help me with my future projects but overall it was very interesting to challenge myself.
